# Monty Hall Problem Simulation 🎭🚪

Simulate the famous **Monty Hall Problem**, where a contestant chooses between three doors:
- One hides a **car** 🎉.
- Two hide **goats** 🐐.

### Game Flow:
1. Pick a door (don’t open it).
2. Host reveals a goat behind another door.
3. Decide to **switch** or **stay**. Does switching improve your odds?

---

## Strategies Simulated
1. **Never Switch**: Stick with your initial choice.
2. **Always Switch**: Switch to the other door.
3. **Random Switch**: Switch with 50% probability.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/monty-hall-simulation.git
   cd monty-hall-simulation
   ```
2. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python monty_hall_simulations.py
   ```

---

## Results (Typical)
- **Never Switch**: ~33% win rate.
- **Always Switch**: ~66% win rate.
- **Random Switch**: ~50% win rate.

The Monty Hall problem demonstrates the **counterintuitive nature of probability**: switching doubles your chance of winning!
